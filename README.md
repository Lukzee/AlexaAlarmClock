# AlexaAlarmClock

When I got my Amazon Echo Dot for Christmas, I wanted to program it so it would play my favorite music when I wake up in the morning. 
The problem is, the Echo Dot only plays sounds in the morning, but I wanted music. I also didn't want to wake up and yell to the other 
room for Alexa to play music. I am not a morning person, I don't want to talk to Alexa or anyone else until after my first cup of coffee.

I found a hack to recored my voice giving Alexa the command, then put the recorded file in my phone in the Alarms section.
Then at my wake-up alarm time my voice goes off and Alexa plays music. This is a lot of work in case I want to change stations, or have the news weather and traffice one day and music the next. Also my command in mp3 on my phone repeats and repeats until I get up and turn it off. So when I get to the next room I have my music station playing, along with my command repeating and repeating!

So I came up with the idea of The Alexa Alarm Clock. I want to 
1) record my voice giving Alexa a command.
2) Play back once the command at a set time
3) Stack commands, such as:
  Alexa, Start the Coffee. (wait for response) 
    -Coffee maker will be going
  Alexa, play Lindsey Sterling. (wait for response)
    -Music will be playing
  (give me 5 minutes to wake up)
  Alexa, What is on my schedule today?
    -Alexa reads my schedule with music in the background
    -Lindsey Sterling Continues.
4) All this happens with some set-up, but I don't need to be present. (mentally)
5) This keeps the electronic devices out of my bedroom, and makes my Echo Dot automate my busy morning.
